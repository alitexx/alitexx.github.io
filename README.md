# / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
# == 1.0 ==
- Initial release!

# == 1.1 BETA ==
- Fixed bug that made it impossible to make drinks after you've made three
- NEW CUSTOMERS ADDED! There used to be 10, but now we have a whopping 20 people!! Thank you to everyone that helped me make the sprites <3

- The position of the frothing jug will now change according to the drink size
- Added a mini-game (of sorts) to the opening screen! Enjoy! :3

# == Known Bugs == 
 - Right now, the biggest known bug (that I didn't want to touch and still don't really) is the grab/pull system. It's generally used when pulling a menu, cup, topping, really everywhere! The problem is, it's supposed to stop following your mouse and return to it's initial position when you let go of the mouse. If you're flinging your mouse about wildly, or trying to be fast, it stays locked to your mouse movements. Although I've grown use to maneuvering around it, I know many others probably can't STAND it. I'll be sure to address this when I find a way to get past it lol
- I have not tested this NEARLY as much as I should have, meaning it's gonna be the wild west out there. Let me know if you find any bugs on my discord, alitexx#0664 !

# == Future Updates ==
 In the future, I'd like to update...
  - Graphics/graphic glitches
  - Add a highscore system that saves even AFTER you leave the browser!
  - On that note, add a global highscore system so you can compete with friends
  - Maybe find a way so you don't have to download the font, wouldn't that be lovely
