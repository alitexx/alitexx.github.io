Formula for adding new units :
 - Add their image icon to the everyImage[] array in index.html
 - got to globals_customerData.js and add their images in the DISPLAYED_customer_order array
 - make sure you know what their drink is by the time 
 - scroll down and add their name to the findNewCustomer() switch statement. remember to add 1 to the multiplied value!
 - take a screenshot of the menu as they order it so you can use it later, this makes it easier for the game to render it in + im lazy
 - crop it perfectly or i'll lose my mind. use an existing menu for reference
 - put their menu (and og character sprite) in spawnOrderForm() (found in menuBar.js
 - in classDrink.js, scroll to customerRating() (around line 60-65) and add info that the function needs, which is their entire order
 - oh good lord screen 5
 - first go to the switch statement at the beginning of screen5(), do case "the menu" : and then change the variable images to the correct drink size/person
 - i think thats it
